1. API (Application Programming Interface)
  
Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant.
You (the user or application) tell the waiter what you want.
The waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server).
The kitchen prepares your food (data) and the waiter brings it back to you.
An API is simply a set of rules that lets different programs talk to each other.
It decides how requests should be made.
It decides what information will be given back.

Example:
When you use a weather app, it doesn’t store all the world’s weather data in your phone.
Instead, it calls a weather API that sends back the latest weather information for your location

2. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

If the API is the waiter, JSON is the plate of food the waiter brings you.
JSON is a lightweight, human-readable format for sending and receiving data.
It stores data in key-value pairs — like labels and their details.
Why JSON is loved:
Easy for humans to read and write.
Easy for machines to understand.
Works with almost every programming language
